## Welcome to MyClassifieds

This is a start up template for any ASP.NET project.  It includes a more elaborated and complete user's authentication system than the one created and provided by Visual Studio, it has an extended authentication system with email verification, a password recovery and a both an automatic and a manual account verification system.

A great start up template for begginers.

Mean while, I can keep learning how to use this [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/daprose-dotcom/MyClassifieds/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my [Markdown files].

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/daprose-dotcom/MyClassifieds/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
